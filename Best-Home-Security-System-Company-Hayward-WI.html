Or, if Arlo Pro finds a sound, you can have your lights set to turn on. Sadly, the combination with SmartThings still has bugs and not whatever works as it should; nevertheless, the capacity is still there.</p>
<p>The price of admission for the Deep Guard Home Security system isn't that steep, even at $499, since it includes three outdoor cameras with two-way audio.

That individual at Deep Sentinel's center can caution a suspicious person that they're being observed, and they can call your local police dispatcher if they refuse to leave or engage in a criminal act.
