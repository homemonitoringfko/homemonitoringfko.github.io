<p>Absolutely nothing is more important than securing what you treasure most ... your family and home. The implicit validation for the current push to increase video surveillance is the hazard of terrorist attacks. But suicide assailants are clearly not deterred by camera - and might even be attracted to the television protection cameras can guarantee - and the cost of a substantial video surveillance system such as Britain's - which sucks up around 20 percent of that country's criminal justice budget - far goes beyond the restricted benefits that the system may offer in investigating attacks or tried attacks after the fact (see truth sheet on Surveillance Cameras and the Attempted London Attacks ).</p>

If there is a real emergency situation, the monitoring experts will dispatch authorities in your place.</p>
