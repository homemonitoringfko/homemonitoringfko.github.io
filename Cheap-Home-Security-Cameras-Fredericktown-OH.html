As an outcome, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the goal of recording video of everybody entering the store. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, once clients recognize that the inexpensive consumer camera they bought is doing not have HDR, it's usually far too late given that the recorders and cameras are set up.</p>
