The implicit justification for the recent push to increase video surveillance is the risk of terrorist attacks. However suicide enemies are plainly not hindered by camera - and might even be brought in to the television coverage cameras can ensure - and the cost of an extensive video surveillance system such as Britain's - which draws up approximately 20 percent of that country's criminal justice budget - far goes beyond the restricted benefits that the system might offer in investigating attacks or tried attacks after the fact (see fact sheet on Surveillance Cameras and the Attempted London Attacks ).</p>
