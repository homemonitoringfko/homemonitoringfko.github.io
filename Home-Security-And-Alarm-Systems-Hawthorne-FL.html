<p>We mounted our test group of outdoor Wi-Fi cameras to a board outside your home so we could point them at the exact same area and expose them all to the same lighting conditions and New England weather condition. The exceptions were cameras that were integrated into outdoor lighting fixtures, which I had installed on the deck by a licensed electrician (who takes place to be my hubby). All of the cameras were linked to the exact same 2.4 GHz network via a Wi-Fi router indoors (roughly 40 feet from the cameras); service to your home was Verizon Fios.</p>
