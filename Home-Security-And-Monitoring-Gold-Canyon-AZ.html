<p>Nevermind how fantastic the cameras are. The first question you should be asking is which of these companies is selling your data to 3rd party companies? I've ditched my Nest Cams given that they were purchased by Google. Something we all need to think about. Sirens. So your camera has found trespassers or wild animals. Do you want to scare them off? A blast from a 100+ decibel siren will do the trick. Note that these sirens may violate local noise control laws, so inspect ahead of time before making the purchase.</p>
<p>Any outdoor camera worth its salt should be able to endure exposure to the components and need to carry an IP (Ingress Protection) score IP scores consist of two digits that inform you just how well the camera will hold up under a lot of climate condition. The first digit following the IP prefix tells you how resistant the camera is to the ingress of solid items such as wind-blown dust and varies from 0 (no protection) to 6 (total protection versus dust and dirt). The 2nd number tells you how resistant the camera is to moisture and ranges from 0 (no protection) to 9 (safeguarded against close quarters, high pressure spray downs from all angles).</p>
<p>We also like that Ring still has decent wise home support. Some other cheap security systems, like SimpliSafe and Cove, do not work so well with wise home gadgets like lights and locks. Ring Alarm supports Z-Wave, so you can integrate your smart outlets with your total security system. Wireless keypads and keychains so you can control your alarm system from anywhere inside or near your business. </p>
