We found the Circle 2 isn't rather as good as the Nest Camera for outdoor usage. It has a 10-foot power cord that limits placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can include a weatherproof cord, but doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest). Also, if you don't opt to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to sign up for a $10 month-to-month Circle Safe subscription to have taping storage and advanced functions, such as alerts that distinguish between people and general motion. We think that's costly.</p>

We have actually encountered a couple of technical concerns while long-lasting screening the Residence Iota, and so will continue to test and upgrade accordingly. We no longer recommend it.</p>

The app is great and slick, enhancing the camera's own cool design, and you can manage the Circle through Amazon Alexa, Apple HomeKit or one of Logitech's Pop smart home buttons.</p>
