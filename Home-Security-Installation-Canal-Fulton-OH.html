<p>MAC filtering is effective just for small residential (SOHO) networks, because it supplies protection just when the wireless gadget is "off the air". Any 802.11 gadget "on the air" freely sends its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it requires no special equipment or software to spot it. Anybody with an 802.11 receiver (laptop and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless packet analyzer can get the MAC address of any transmitting 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless gadgets are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering provides only an incorrect sense of security since it prevents just "casual" or unintended connections to the organizational infrastructure and does nothing to avoid a directed attack.</p>
