<p>With modern burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the best defense possible from break-ins and theft. We found the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Web cam for outdoor usage. It has a 10-foot power cable that restricts positioning, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cable, however doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest). Likewise, if you do not choose to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to register for a $10 regular monthly Circle Safe membership to have tape-recording storage and advanced features, such as alerts that distinguish between individuals and basic motion. We believe that's expensive.</p>

You can easily arm the sensors when you leave for optimal security. Needs to your system be activated, an alarm will sound and signals are sent instantly to your 24-hour Central Station Monitoring Company.</p>
