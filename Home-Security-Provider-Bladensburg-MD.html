<p>We have actually all heard that old stating, you get what you pay for".

<p>A system that requires an agreement might be a smart option for those who are cash-strapped or don't wish to spend for the equipment up-front. Why? Because contract-based security systems generally do not featured upfront charges. Rather, the costs are expanded over the length of the agreement. We have actually seen 1-year, all the way up to 5-year contracts!
