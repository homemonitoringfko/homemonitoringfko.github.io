<p>But monitored systems also tend to have a service agreement, which locks you into paying an often-pricey monthly fee for a set quantity of time, normally one to 5 years. No-contract systems, which permit you to pay for monitoring services on a month-to-month basis rather than dedicating to a long-term arrangement, are becoming more common. These systems often cost more in advance for the hardware than professional systems that provide a discount in exchange for that prolonged service contract. Paying for the equipment in advance offers you with a great deal of control over what you get, where you can put it, and how you utilize the service. And you can begin and stop the monitoring service as many times as you desire.</p>
