The previous, more affordable version of the outdoor Nest cam is still on sale too if you want to conserve some cash - it does have a cable connected though, rather than working wirelessly, which indicates it's a bit easier to screw up for prospective trespassers. Definitely among the best security cameras in 2020.</p>
