<p>The Google Nest Camera IQ Outdoor is the most technologically advanced outdoor camera we have actually evaluated. It has a close-up tracking function, which automatically zooms in on motion and after that follows it around the field of view. To make those images clear, it has an 8-megapixel 4K sensing unit, HDR (high dynamic range), and 12 x digital zoom. It can distinguish between basic motion and individuals, so it reduces false alarms, and it can even identify individuals you have actually labeled (after a knowing period). But like all Nest cameras, this one requires the Nest Aware service to do anything beyond live viewing.</p>
<p>The most significant, baddest feature is the Arlo Ultra's 4K video streaming with HDR, which offers you incredibly crisp, clear video footage that lets you zoom in on details like faces and license plates without messing up your image quality. The Nest Labs Nest Webcam provides higher-than-typical 1080p video resolution. Ramping up into security services fits with this, too. Lennar, as it happens, is directly connected now on Amazon's security homepage, but to be clear, the offering is not exclusive to Lennar property owners. </p>
