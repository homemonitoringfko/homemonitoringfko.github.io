Let's dive in.</p>

After using designs long-lasting for over a year, in addition to testing numerous new designs, we still think the Logitech Circle 2 is the best indoor security camera.</p>
<p>Another area where Arlo excels is customer care.

As such, even if somebody get into your home in complete darkness, you'll still have the ability to see them in your smartphone app. The only problem here is that the taped footage will be black and white and a little dark so you may not be able to see details plainly.</p>

One of the most significant benefits of this function is it avoids you from being alerted of irrelevant activity, like a cars and truck driving by or an insect zipping your camera. The Deep Guard differs from every other home security camera. That's because when the camera area an intruder, it sends out a live feed to a monitoring station, where an expert can sound an alarm on the camera, scream a caution, and if needed, contact the police.</p>
