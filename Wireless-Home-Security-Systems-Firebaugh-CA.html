<p>Vivint Outdoor Camera Pro: As security system cameras go, the Vivint Outdoor Camera Pro is among the best-- and it will deal with the rest of your Vivint system. The small, black orb of a dome camera offers a much better field of vision than its bullet equivalent. It's also more subtle, more durable types of security cameras on the market.

<p>The Google Nest Camera IQ Outdoor is the most technologically sophisticated outdoor camera we have actually tested. It has a close-up tracking feature, which immediately zooms in on motion and after that follows it around the field of vision.

It can compare basic motion and people, so it reduces incorrect alarms, and it can even determine individuals you have actually identified (after a learning period). But like all Nest cameras, this one requires the Nest Aware service to do anything beyond live watching.</p>
<p>Our experience with expert installation was mixed. Our tester stated the service technician provided solid customer support: He dropped a couple of unnecessary window sensors from my expense after choosing that the motion detector sufficed for the whole front half of my home." However, there were some concerns with linking the command center to our tester's network. </p>
