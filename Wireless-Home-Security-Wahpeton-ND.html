<p>A tight wire perimeter security system is generally an independent screen of tensioned tripwires typically mounted on a fence or wall. Additionally, the screen can be made so thick that there is no requirement for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are developed to find any physical attempt to penetrate the barrier. Tight wire systems can operate with a range of switches or detectors that sense movement at each end of the tense wires. These switches or detectors can be a simple mechanical contact, static force transducer or an electronic strain gauge. Undesirable alarms caused by birds and other animals can be avoided by changing the sensors to overlook things that exert small amounts of pressure on the wires. This kind of system is susceptible to intruders digging under the fence. A concrete footing directly below the fence is set up to avoid this kind of attack.</p>
